# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deployment

This application is configured to be deployed on **Firebase App Hosting**.

The `apphosting.yaml` file in the root of the project contains the configuration for the deployment. For a standard deployment, you do not need to modify this file.

You can deploy your application by connecting your project to a GitHub repository and setting up a hosting backend in the Firebase console.
